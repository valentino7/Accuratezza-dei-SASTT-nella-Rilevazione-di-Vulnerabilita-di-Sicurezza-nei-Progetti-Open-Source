Once the attacker has this information, they can potentially impersonate a user, accessing confidential data and performing actions that they would not normally be authorized to do. Attackers often gain access to this sensitive cookie data when it is transmitted insecurely in plain text over a standard HTTP session, rather than being encrypted and sent over an HTTPS session. This type of attack is highly preventable by following best practices when setting sensitive session cookies.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Set the `secure` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side, and use a test tool to verify that secure cookie transmission is in place.\n* Always use HTTPS for all login pages and never redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, which leaves secure session data open to interception.\n* Follow other best practices when it comes to session cookies, such as setting the HttpOnly flag and maintaining highly time-limited sessions.\n* Consider implementing browser checks and providing secure data only within a browser that supports tight cookie security.\n* Generate session IDs in a way that is not easily predictable, invalidate sessions upon logout, and never reuse session IDs.\n* Educate developers to use built-in secure session-management functionality within the development environment instead of taking a DIY approach.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).",

Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered. However, if an outdated or custom programmed hashing scheme is used, it becomes simple for an attacker with powerful modern computing power to gain access to the hashes used. This opens up access to all stored password information, leading to breached security. Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.",

While they are responsible for removing these before production, occasionally this task may fall through the cracks. This also becomes a maintenance challenge when credentials are re-used across multiple applications.\n\nOnce attackers gain access, they may take advantage of privilege level to remove or alter data, take down a site or app, or hold any of the above for ransom. The risk across multiple similar projects is even greater. If code containing the credentials is reused across multiple projects, they will all be compromised.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Plan software architecture such that keys and passwords are always stored outside the code, wherever possible.\n* Plan encryption into software architecture for all credential information and ensure proper handling of keys, credentials, and passwords.\n* Prompt for a secure password on first login rather than hard-code a default password.\n* If a hardcoded password or credential must be used, limit its use, for example, to system console users rather than via the network.\n* Use strong hashes for inbound password authentication, ideally with randomly assigned salts to increase the difficulty level in case of brute-force attack.",

By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```",

                "markdown": "\n## Details\n\nCRLF is an abbreviation for the terms \"carriage return\" and \"line feed.\" These two special characters are a legacy of old-fashioned printing terminals used in the early days of computing. However, today both are still often used as delimiters between data. When this weakness exists, CR and LF characters (represented respectively in code as `\\r` and `\\n`) are permitted to be present in HTTP headers, usually due to poor planning for data handling during development.\n\nCRLF sequences in HTTP headers are known as \"response splitting\" because these characters effectively split the response from the browser, causing the single line to be accepted as multiple lines by the server (for example, the single line First Line\\r\\nSecond Line would be accepted by the server as two lines of input).\n\nWhile response splitting in itself is not an attack, and can be completely harmless unless exploited, its presence could lead to an injection attack (known as CRLF injection) and a variety of unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior. This weakness can be exploited in a number of ways, such as page hijacking or cross-user defacement, in which an attacker displays false site content and/or captures confidential information such as credentials. It can even lead to cross-site scripting attacks, in which attackers can cause malicious code to execute in the user's browser.\n\nFor example, the following code is vulnerable:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", request.getParameter(\"name\"));\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nbecause the user may provide a name parameter with a value like `XYZ\\r\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nATTACKER CONTROLLED`. In this case, they will produce a second HTTP response:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nATTACKER CONTROLLED\n```\n\nA possible fix is to remove all non-alphanumerical characters:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  String name = request.getParameter(\"name\")\n      .replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\");\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", name);\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the attacker would be unable to produce a second HTTP response.\n\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Assume all input is potentially malicious. Define acceptable responses wherever possible, and if not possible, encode CR and LF characters to prevent header splitting.\n* Replace both `\\r` (carriage return) and `\\n` (line feed) with \"\" (empty string)-many platforms handle these characters interchangeably so the weakness may still exist if one of the two is permitted.\nFollow best practices and strip all other special characters (\", /, \\, ;, etc., as well as spaces) wherever possible.\nBe sure to sanitize special characters in both directions-from the browser to the server and also in data sent back to the browser.\nIdeally, adopt current development resources, such as languages and libraries, that block CR and LF injection in headers.\nBe vigilant with all input types that could potentially be tampered with or modified at the user end (intentionally or unintentionally), which could lead to injection attacks. These include GET, POST, cookies, and other HTTP headers.",

This helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks, in which an attacker gains access to sensitive session information and uses this information to trick legitimate web-based applications into disclosing confidential information or accepting illegitimate requests. When developers use the `HttpOnly` flag to set the cookie, they ensure that this sensitive session information is not readable or writable except by the browser (read) and server (write), respectively. While most modern browsers and versions now recognize the HttpOnly flag, some legacy and custom browsers still do not.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Include the `HttpOnly` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side. Be aware, however, that this crucial step provides only partial remediation.\n* Integrate client-side scripts to determine browser version; require browser compatibility or avoid transmitting sensitive data to browsers that do not support `HttpOnly`.\n* Understand and evaluate risks of third-party components or plugins, which may expose cookies.\n* Educate developers in a zero-trust approach, understanding the risks and best practices to prevent cross-site scripting, such as sanitizing all user input for code and special characters.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```",

Developers may rely on plain-text storage of credentials when they believe the system is completely secure from attack or only accessible to insiders. This confidence is misguided and dangerous. If a malicious insider-such as a former employee-or a hostile attacker using SQL injection, XML injection, or a brute-force attack accesses the system, they can access this credential information to gain unauthorized permissions within the system and to export other confidential and secure information.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Ensure that passwords are never stored in plain text, even for \"purely internal\" use.\n* Never rely on password encoding, such as base 64 encoding; choose a complex encryption algorithm that includes salting, then hashing.\n* Implement zero-trust approaches in which users have access only to information needed for legitimate business purposes.\n* To the greatest extent possible, secure the application against injection attacks and other types of weaknesses.",

Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered. However, if an outdated or custom programmed hashing scheme is used, it becomes simple for an attacker with powerful modern computing power to gain access to the hashes used. This opens up access to all stored password information, leading to breached security. Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser's Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they've been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser.|\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user's browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:\n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.",

                "markdown": "\n## Details\n\nCRLF is an abbreviation for the terms \"carriage return\" and \"line feed.\" These two special characters are a legacy of old-fashioned printing terminals used in the early days of computing. However, today both are still often used as delimiters between data. When this weakness exists, CR and LF characters (represented respectively in code as `\\r` and `\\n`) are permitted to be present in HTTP headers, usually due to poor planning for data handling during development.\n\nCRLF sequences in HTTP headers are known as \"response splitting\" because these characters effectively split the response from the browser, causing the single line to be accepted as multiple lines by the server (for example, the single line First Line\\r\\nSecond Line would be accepted by the server as two lines of input).\n\nWhile response splitting in itself is not an attack, and can be completely harmless unless exploited, its presence could lead to an injection attack (known as CRLF injection) and a variety of unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior. This weakness can be exploited in a number of ways, such as page hijacking or cross-user defacement, in which an attacker displays false site content and/or captures confidential information such as credentials. It can even lead to cross-site scripting attacks, in which attackers can cause malicious code to execute in the user's browser.\n\nFor example, the following code is vulnerable:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", request.getParameter(\"name\"));\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nbecause the user may provide a name parameter with a value like `XYZ\\r\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nATTACKER CONTROLLED`. In this case, they will produce a second HTTP response:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nATTACKER CONTROLLED\n```\n\nA possible fix is to remove all non-alphanumerical characters:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  String name = request.getParameter(\"name\")\n      .replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\");\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", name);\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the attacker would be unable to produce a second HTTP response.\n\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Assume all input is potentially malicious. Define acceptable responses wherever possible, and if not possible, encode CR and LF characters to prevent header splitting.\n* Replace both `\\r` (carriage return) and `\\n` (line feed) with \"\" (empty string)-many platforms handle these characters interchangeably so the weakness may still exist if one of the two is permitted.\nFollow best practices and strip all other special characters (\", /, \\, ;, etc., as well as spaces) wherever possible.\nBe sure to sanitize special characters in both directions-from the browser to the server and also in data sent back to the browser.\nIdeally, adopt current development resources, such as languages and libraries, that block CR and LF injection in headers.\nBe vigilant with all input types that could potentially be tampered with or modified at the user end (intentionally or unintentionally), which could lead to injection attacks. These include GET, POST, cookies, and other HTTP headers.",
