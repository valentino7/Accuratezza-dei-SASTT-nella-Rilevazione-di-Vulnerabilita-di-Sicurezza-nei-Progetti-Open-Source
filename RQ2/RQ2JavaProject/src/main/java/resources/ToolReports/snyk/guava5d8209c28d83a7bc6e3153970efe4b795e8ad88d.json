By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```",

This helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks, in which an attacker gains access to sensitive session information and uses this information to trick legitimate web-based applications into disclosing confidential information or accepting illegitimate requests. When developers use the `HttpOnly` flag to set the cookie, they ensure that this sensitive session information is not readable or writable except by the browser (read) and server (write), respectively. While most modern browsers and versions now recognize the HttpOnly flag, some legacy and custom browsers still do not.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Include the `HttpOnly` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side. Be aware, however, that this crucial step provides only partial remediation.\n* Integrate client-side scripts to determine browser version; require browser compatibility or avoid transmitting sensitive data to browsers that do not support `HttpOnly`.\n* Understand and evaluate risks of third-party components or plugins, which may expose cookies.\n* Educate developers in a zero-trust approach, understanding the risks and best practices to prevent cross-site scripting, such as sanitizing all user input for code and special characters.",

For example, if a breached authentication token is hardcoded in multiple places in the application, it may lead to components of the application remaining vulnerable if not all instances are changed.\nAnother negative effect of hard-coding constants is potential unpredictability in the application's performance if the development team fails to update every single instance of the hardcoded constant throughout the code. For these reasons, hard-coding security-relevant constants is considered bad coding practice and should be remedied if present and avoided in future.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Never hard code security-related constants; use symbolic names or configuration lookup files.\n* As hard coding is often done by coders working alone on a small scale, examine all legacy code components and test carefully when scaling.\n* Adopt a \"future-proof code\" mindset: While use of constants may save a little time now and make development simpler in the short term, it could cost time and money adapting to scale or other unforeseen circumstances (such as new hardware) in the future.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nWith an OS command injection attack a web application user can pass commands directly to the system shell, attached to a legitimate request. These commands can then be executed on the application server, potentially leading to harmful consequences, including data exposure or deletion. Like code injection attacks, command injection attacks are essentially a failure of data validation. Unlike code injection attacks, which introduce new code, command injection attacks use existing system functions, often taking advantage of the application's unnecessarily high privilege level, increasing the risk of serious harm and reputational damage.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n- Never trust user input. Assume any input may transmit harmful values.\n- Adopt the principle of least privilege: No application should have a greater access level than needed to run its required tasks.\n- Control user access policies on a task-by-task basis.\n- Don't pass user input directly to the system; use libraries or APIs that lack system access.\n- Where shell commands must be passed, escape values using functions like shlex for Python, or escapeshellarg() for PHP.\n- Sanitize user input with regular expressions to define permitted characters along with maximum string length.\n- Convert special characters such as `& |  ; $ > < \\ !` before passing to the server.\n- Whitelist permitted commands and validate user responses against these expectations.\n- Remember that code injection can take place on multiple fronts: GET and POST requests, but also cookies and HTTP headers.\n- Ensure up-to-date patching across all systems to remediate known vulnerabilities.\n- Educate all team members on safer data handling procedures to prevent attacks.",

Every developer is aware of the risks of transmitting sensitive information in plain text. Yet many still use outdated or inferior cryptographic methods to protect information under their control. As cryptographic methods grow stronger with time, code must be updated to incorporate more modern and secure cryptography.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid using DES, and use AES (in a secure mode, such as Galois/Counter Mode) or another strong encryption algorithm instead.\n* Be aware of outdated hashes, such as MD5 and SHA1 (along with many others); recognize and implement current cryptographic standards instead.\n* Never use custom or DIY security and cryptographic methods; instead, use methods that are part of an accepted library or framework.\n* Ensure that code dealing with cryptographic methods is highly modular and can be easily replaced as security standards change.\n* Increase developer awareness of proper encryption key management and protection to ensure best practices throughout the application.",

In a timing attack, program state is inferred from the time it takes to execute a particular operation. For example, an app might use a lookup table of valid session IDs to speed up access.\nWhile this is convenient for validated users, an invalid session ID will take far longer to be rejected (since it's not in the lookup table), giving the attackers a valuable way to engineer a brute-force attack. All they need to do is test a large number of randomly generated session IDs in the hope of discovering a valid one. Once access is granted, through the session ID, the malicious actor may impersonate a legitimate user, executing actions or freely accessing secure data. Through brute force, such as a massive bot attack, this weakness can be successfully exploited to bypass even very strong encryption algorithms.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Implement a constant-time algorithm to ensure that timing is identical regardless of input validity and returned outcome.\n* If a constant-time algorithm is impractical due to a desire to optimize performance, choose another technique such as blinding.\n* Promote an awareness among developers that encryption is not enough if your app is giving off clues to help attackers.\n* Timing attacks often depend on the production environment and are thus difficult to test during development; be sure to use a staging environment as close as possible to production.\n* Choose hardened, reliable libraries for encryption and authentication with side-channel attack protection strategies rather than implementing your own methods.",

This includes accessing code or content they are not authorized to view and changing or taking down a site or app, often with a demand for ransom. Every developer is aware of the risks of transmitting sensitive information in plain text. Yet many still use outdated or inferior cryptographic methods to protect information under their control. As cryptographic methods grow stronger with time, code must be updated to incorporate more modern and secure cryptography.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid using DES, and use AES (in a secure mode, such as Galois/Counter Mode) or another strong encryption algorithm instead.\n* Be aware of outdated hashes, such as MD5 and SHA1 (along with many others); recognize and implement current cryptographic standards instead.\n* Never use custom or DIY security and cryptographic methods; instead, use methods that are part of an accepted library or framework.\n* Ensure that code dealing with cryptographic methods is highly modular and can be easily replaced as security standards change.\n* Increase developer awareness of proper encryption key management and protection to ensure best practices throughout the application.",

Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered. However, if an outdated or custom programmed hashing scheme is used, it becomes simple for an attacker with powerful modern computing power to gain access to the hashes used. This opens up access to all stored password information, leading to breached security. Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.",

For example, if a breached authentication token is hardcoded in multiple places in the application, it may lead to components of the application remaining vulnerable if not all instances are changed.\nAnother negative effect of hard-coding constants is potential unpredictability in the application's performance if the development team fails to update every single instance of the hardcoded constant throughout the code. For these reasons, hard-coding security-relevant constants is considered bad coding practice and should be remedied if present and avoided in future.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n- Never hard code security-related constants; use symbolic names or configuration lookup files.\n- As hard coding is often done by coders working alone on a small scale, examine all legacy code components and test carefully when scaling.\n- Adopt a \"future-proof code\" mindset: While use of constants may save a little time now and make development simpler in the short term, it could cost time and money adapting to scale or other unforeseen circumstances (such as new hardware) in the future.",

In a timing attack, program state is inferred from the time it takes to execute a particular operation. For example, an app might use a lookup table of valid session IDs to speed up access.\nWhile this is convenient for validated users, an invalid session ID will take far longer to be rejected (since it's not in the lookup table), giving the attackers a valuable way to engineer a brute-force attack. All they need to do is test a large number of randomly generated session IDs in the hope of discovering a valid one. Once access is granted, through the session ID, the malicious actor may impersonate a legitimate user, executing actions or freely accessing secure data. Through brute force, such as a massive bot attack, this weakness can be successfully exploited to bypass even very strong encryption algorithms.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Implement a constant-time algorithm to ensure that timing is identical regardless of input validity and returned outcome.\n* If a constant-time algorithm is impractical due to a desire to optimize performance, choose another technique such as blinding.\n* Promote an awareness among developers that encryption is not enough if your app is giving off clues to help attackers.\n* Timing attacks often depend on the production environment and are thus difficult to test during development; be sure to use a staging environment as close as possible to production.\n* Choose hardened, reliable libraries for encryption and authentication with side-channel attack protection strategies rather than implementing your own methods.",

The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered. However, if an outdated or custom programmed hashing scheme is used, it becomes simple for an attacker with powerful modern computing power to gain access to the hashes used. This opens up access to all stored password information, leading to breached security. Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.",

Attackers can then use information gleaned to perform a variety of actions, depending on the information type.

The XML processor then uses the system identifier to access the resource rather than using the URI. When this weakness exists, the application permits user-supplied data, which could include the address of an XML external identity, to be passed directly to the XML parser. The application will then attempt to retrieve documents from outside of secure, controlled areas.\n\nAttackers can exploit this weakness to expose sensitive data, execute port scanning on the server side, or launch a denial-of-service attack (DoS) such as Billion Laughs.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n\n* When possible, disable loading of data from external entities. The method of doing this will vary based on the language and XML parser being used.\n* Use a local, static document type definitions (DTDs) and ensure that external DTDs are disallowed entirely.\n* If user input cannot be avoided, perform validation against an allowlist of possible data sources. However, as long as external DTDs are allowed, XML code remains inherently vulnerable to attacks exploiting this weakness.",

The server then accesses the URL and shares its results, which may include sensitive information such as AWS metadata, internal configuration information, or database contents with the attacker. Because the request comes from the back end, it bypasses access controls, potentially exposing information the user does not have sufficient privileges to receive. The attacker can then exploit this information to gain access, modify the web application, or demand a ransom payment.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Blacklists are problematic and attackers have numerous ways to bypass them; ideally, use a whitelist of all permitted domains and IP addresses.\n* Use authentication even within your own network to prevent exploitation of server-side requests.\n* Implement zero trust and sanitize and validate all URL and header data returning to the server from the user. Strip invalid or suspect characters, then inspect to be certain it contains a valid and expected value.\n* Ideally, avoid sending server requests based on user-provided data altogether.\n* Ensure that you are not sending raw response bodies from the server directly to the client. Only deliver expected responses.\n* Disable suspect and exploitable URL schemas. Common culprits include obscure and little-used schemas such as `file://`, `dict://`, `ftp://`, and `gopher://`.",

One of the most common applications of LDAP servers is to orchestrate user sessions, making it easier for users to access multiple services through a single sign-on. An LDAP injection attack occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to these centralized stores of user data. If an attacker succeeds in injecting arbitrary, unsanitized information into an LDAP query, the attacker can gain access to credentials or content and/or perform unauthorized actions. This could include adding or modifying records within the centralized data store itself, such as erasing or altering records.\nAs with other injection-type attacks, like SQL injection, LDAP injection attacks are highly preventable through safer web application design and coding practices.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Never pass user input directly to the LDAP query.\n* Sanitize all input prior to processing as appropriate for the particular input type.\n* Escape all LDAP specific characters, such as, `#,\",+, ;, <, >, \\` and null, replacing with ASCII hex values. However, do not rely solely on denylists or escaped characters for defense against LDAP injection attacks.\n* For tighter security, consider validating input against an allowlist (\"accept known good\") to ensure that only certain parameters can be passed.\n* Assume all user input is potentially malicious.\n* Adopt development frameworks that specifically provide protection against LDAP injection attacks.",

In this case, the input string is passed directly from the user to a format function such as printf (this weakness appears primarily in C-type languages).\n\nFormat functions were originally designed to provide more flexible output options through specified parameters. However, if input is passed directly from the user to the site or application without sanitization, an attacker may add special characters that will then be interpreted as formatting parameters, causing the application to behave unpredictably, read/write in unauthorized memory locations, crash, or even permit the attacker to execute commands. Since format functions with this weakness may behave exactly like properly coded format functions (until the weakness is exploited), it may be difficult to identify with standard testing.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Implement constraints for user input wherever possible (permitted length, special characters, etc.).\n* Always perform input validation; never pass user data directly to the application.\n* Avoid single-parameter calls to format functions. Always pass a format-specifying parameter, ideally one that is not user-controlled, to the format function in addition to the text output. Never allow user-controlled input to be the only parameter passed.",

While they are responsible for removing these before production, occasionally this task may fall through the cracks. This also becomes a maintenance challenge when credentials are re-used across multiple applications.\n\nOnce attackers gain access, they may take advantage of privilege level to remove or alter data, take down a site or app, or hold any of the above for ransom. The risk across multiple similar projects is even greater. If code containing the credentials is reused across multiple projects, they will all be compromised.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Plan software architecture such that keys and passwords are always stored outside the code, wherever possible.\n* Plan encryption into software architecture for all credential information and ensure proper handling of keys, credentials, and passwords.\n* Prompt for a secure password on first login rather than hard-code a default password.\n* If a hardcoded password or credential must be used, limit its use, for example, to system console users rather than via the network.\n* Use strong hashes for inbound password authentication, ideally with randomly assigned salts to increase the difficulty level in case of brute-force attack.",

Once the attacker has this information, they can potentially impersonate a user, accessing confidential data and performing actions that they would not normally be authorized to do. Attackers often gain access to this sensitive cookie data when it is transmitted insecurely in plain text over a standard HTTP session, rather than being encrypted and sent over an HTTPS session. This type of attack is highly preventable by following best practices when setting sensitive session cookies.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Set the `secure` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side, and use a test tool to verify that secure cookie transmission is in place.\n* Always use HTTPS for all login pages and never redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, which leaves secure session data open to interception.\n* Follow other best practices when it comes to session cookies, such as setting the HttpOnly flag and maintaining highly time-limited sessions.\n* Consider implementing browser checks and providing secure data only within a browser that supports tight cookie security.\n* Generate session IDs in a way that is not easily predictable, invalidate sessions upon logout, and never reuse session IDs.\n* Educate developers to use built-in secure session-management functionality within the development environment instead of taking a DIY approach.",

The code is then executed, potentially granting the user system access to export sensitive data, to install malware, or even to move laterally and to exploit other systems in the trusted internal network environment. While code injection attacks can take place in several ways, the common factor is allowing the user to submit executable code to the application. The most common forms of code injection are SQL injection (server side) and cross-site scripting (XSS) (client side).\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n\n- Never trust user input. Assume any input may transmit harmful values.\n- Apply least privilege principle (for example, limit users to read only wherever possible).\n- Avoid passing raw user input directly to functions; use parameterized queries to extract data first.\n- Sanitize user input strings of special characters such as ?, &, /, <, >, and quotation marks.\n- Use whitelisting of known good values.\n- Validate user input against expected response types.\n- Escape shell commands with functions such as shlex for Python, or escapeshellarg for PHP.\n- Remember that code injection can take place on multiple fronts: GET and POST requests, but also cookies and HTTP headers.\n- Ensure up-to-date patching across all systems to remediate known vulnerabilities so these cannot be exploited by code injection.\n- Educate all team members on safe data handling procedures to prevent attacks.",

This includes accessing code or content they are not authorized to view and changing or taking down a site or app, often with a demand for ransom. Every developer is aware of the risks of transmitting sensitive information in plain text. Yet many still use outdated or inferior cryptographic methods to protect information under their control. As cryptographic methods grow stronger with time, code must be updated to incorporate more modern and secure cryptography.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid using DES, and use AES (in a secure mode, such as Galois/Counter Mode) or another strong encryption algorithm instead.\n* Be aware of outdated hashes, such as MD5 and SHA1 (along with many others); recognize and implement current cryptographic standards instead.\n* Never use custom or DIY security and cryptographic methods; instead, use methods that are part of an accepted library or framework.\n* Ensure that code dealing with cryptographic methods is highly modular and can be easily replaced as security standards change.\n* Increase developer awareness of proper encryption key management and protection to ensure best practices throughout the application.",
