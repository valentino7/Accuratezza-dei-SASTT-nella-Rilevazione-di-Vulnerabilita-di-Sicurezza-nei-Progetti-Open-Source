Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered. However, if an outdated or custom programmed hashing scheme is used, it becomes simple for an attacker with powerful modern computing power to gain access to the hashes used. This opens up access to all stored password information, leading to breached security. Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.",

While they are responsible for removing these before production, occasionally this task may fall through the cracks. This also becomes a maintenance challenge when credentials are re-used across multiple applications.\n\nOnce attackers gain access, they may take advantage of privilege level to remove or alter data, take down a site or app, or hold any of the above for ransom. The risk across multiple similar projects is even greater. If code containing the credentials is reused across multiple projects, they will all be compromised.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Plan software architecture such that keys and passwords are always stored outside the code, wherever possible.\n* Plan encryption into software architecture for all credential information and ensure proper handling of keys, credentials, and passwords.\n* Prompt for a secure password on first login rather than hard-code a default password.\n* If a hardcoded password or credential must be used, limit its use, for example, to system console users rather than via the network.\n* Use strong hashes for inbound password authentication, ideally with randomly assigned salts to increase the difficulty level in case of brute-force attack.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser's Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they've been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser.|\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user's browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:\n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.",

If certificate validation is cursory or incomplete, this creates a weakness whereby an attacker can spoof one or more certificate details (e.g., expiration date), gaining unauthorized access to confidential data and privileged actions.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Verify all aspects of any certificate provided, particularly chain of trust (issuing authority), host identity, and expiration.\n* Limit the validity period for certificates.\n* Avoid using self-signed certificates, certificate pinning, and wildcard certificates, as these all add levels of convenience but can also lead to loss of control over site/app security.\n* Disable older and insecure protocols (for example, SSL 2.0/3.0, MD5, and 3DES).\n* Ensure that all team members are familiar with current best practices and approaches, such as current TLS protocols.\n* Implement automated and manual testing using current tools and techniques designed to reveal this and related SSL weaknesses (for example, web application scanners).",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```",

Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered. However, if an outdated or custom programmed hashing scheme is used, it becomes simple for an attacker with powerful modern computing power to gain access to the hashes used. This opens up access to all stored password information, leading to breached security. Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.",

The code is then executed, potentially granting the user system access to export sensitive data, to install malware, or even to move laterally and to exploit other systems in the trusted internal network environment. While code injection attacks can take place in several ways, the common factor is allowing the user to submit executable code to the application. The most common forms of code injection are SQL injection (server side) and cross-site scripting (XSS) (client side).\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n\n- Never trust user input. Assume any input may transmit harmful values.\n- Apply least privilege principle (for example, limit users to read only wherever possible).\n- Avoid passing raw user input directly to functions; use parameterized queries to extract data first.\n- Sanitize user input strings of special characters such as ?, &, /, <, >, and quotation marks.\n- Use whitelisting of known good values.\n- Validate user input against expected response types.\n- Escape shell commands with functions such as shlex for Python, or escapeshellarg for PHP.\n- Remember that code injection can take place on multiple fronts: GET and POST requests, but also cookies and HTTP headers.\n- Ensure up-to-date patching across all systems to remediate known vulnerabilities so these cannot be exploited by code injection.\n- Educate all team members on safe data handling procedures to prevent attacks.",

In general, URL redirection refers to the ability of a website or application to redirect users to another site. This is often a benign and useful feature. For example, if a resource has moved to a new location, URL redirection can transfer the user to that location rather than displaying an error message.\nHowever, this ability can be exploited through social engineering, tricking the user into believing they are accessing one site when, in reality, they are being redirected to a dangerous site, such as a phishing site. Once there, the user may be further tricked into entering credentials or personally identifiable information (PII), believing they are still within the original, trusted domain. Attackers can then use these credentials to gain unauthorized access or leverage the user's PII for sale or ransom.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* When developing a site or web app, consider implementing a disclaimer page to remind users that they are leaving a secure site.\n* Adopt a zero-trust approach in which all input is treated with suspicion.\n* Validate all input against deny-lists to ensure it does not contain code to redirect the user. This method is good but inherently incomplete.\n* Be aware of all sources of untrusted input being sent to the server that could be used to redirect the user, such as cookies, URL components, filenames, query results, request headers, and more.\n* In particular, be aware of potential API calls that could send input indirectly to redirect the user.\n* To protect end users, use a firewall to block known malicious sites, train users to recognize basic signs of a phishing attack, and ensure that all network endpoints are patched with the most current updates.",

If certificate validation is cursory or incomplete, this creates a weakness whereby an attacker can spoof one or more certificate details (e.g., expiration date), gaining unauthorized access to confidential data and privileged actions.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Verify all aspects of any certificate provided, particularly chain of trust (issuing authority), host identity, and expiration.\n* Limit the validity period for certificates.\n* Avoid using self-signed certificates, certificate pinning, and wildcard certificates, as these all add levels of convenience but can also lead to loss of control over site/app security.\n* Disable older and insecure protocols (for example, SSL 2.0/3.0, MD5, and 3DES).\n* Ensure that all team members are familiar with current best practices and approaches, such as current TLS protocols.\n* Implement automated and manual testing using current tools and techniques designed to reveal this and related SSL weaknesses (for example, web application scanners).",

This information may then be intercepted by threat actors using sniffer tools or interception techniques such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks (often involving social engineering). Attackers can then use information gleaned to perform a variety of actions, depending on the information type. Possible actions include gaining unauthorized access, impersonating a user, moving laterally within the organization's network, or retrieving and potentially modifying files. This weakness is almost completely avoidable through intelligent architecture and design.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Build web applications around a security mindset and the awareness that sniffers may be present at any time.\n* Ensure that all sensitive data transmission uses reliable encryption.\n* Implement security measures so that sensitive results are never returned in plain text.\n* Implement multiple-factor authentication methods to validate remote instances.\n* Use SSL not only at logon but throughout communications.",

Once the attacker has this information, they can potentially impersonate a user, accessing confidential data and performing actions that they would not normally be authorized to do. Attackers often gain access to this sensitive cookie data when it is transmitted insecurely in plain text over a standard HTTP session, rather than being encrypted and sent over an HTTPS session. This type of attack is highly preventable by following best practices when setting sensitive session cookies.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Set the `secure` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side, and use a test tool to verify that secure cookie transmission is in place.\n* Always use HTTPS for all login pages and never redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, which leaves secure session data open to interception.\n* Follow other best practices when it comes to session cookies, such as setting the HttpOnly flag and maintaining highly time-limited sessions.\n* Consider implementing browser checks and providing secure data only within a browser that supports tight cookie security.\n* Generate session IDs in a way that is not easily predictable, invalidate sessions upon logout, and never reuse session IDs.\n* Educate developers to use built-in secure session-management functionality within the development environment instead of taking a DIY approach.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser's Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they've been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser.|\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user's browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:\n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.",

For example, if a breached authentication token is hardcoded in multiple places in the application, it may lead to components of the application remaining vulnerable if not all instances are changed.\nAnother negative effect of hard-coding constants is potential unpredictability in the application's performance if the development team fails to update every single instance of the hardcoded constant throughout the code. For these reasons, hard-coding security-relevant constants is considered bad coding practice and should be remedied if present and avoided in future.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Never hard code security-related constants; use symbolic names or configuration lookup files.\n* As hard coding is often done by coders working alone on a small scale, examine all legacy code components and test carefully when scaling.\n* Adopt a \"future-proof code\" mindset: While use of constants may save a little time now and make development simpler in the short term, it could cost time and money adapting to scale or other unforeseen circumstances (such as new hardware) in the future.",

Once the attacker has this information, they can potentially impersonate a user, accessing confidential data and performing actions that they would not normally be authorized to do. Attackers often gain access to this sensitive cookie data when it is transmitted insecurely in plain text over a standard HTTP session, rather than being encrypted and sent over an HTTPS session. This type of attack is highly preventable by following best practices when setting sensitive session cookies.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Set the `secure` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side, and use a test tool to verify that secure cookie transmission is in place.\n* Always use HTTPS for all login pages and never redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, which leaves secure session data open to interception.\n* Follow other best practices when it comes to session cookies, such as setting the HttpOnly flag and maintaining highly time-limited sessions.\n* Consider implementing browser checks and providing secure data only within a browser that supports tight cookie security.\n* Generate session IDs in a way that is not easily predictable, invalidate sessions upon logout, and never reuse session IDs.\n* Educate developers to use built-in secure session-management functionality within the development environment instead of taking a DIY approach.",

While they are responsible for removing these before production, occasionally this task may fall through the cracks. This also becomes a maintenance challenge when credentials are re-used across multiple applications.\n\nOnce attackers gain access, they may take advantage of privilege level to remove or alter data, take down a site or app, or hold any of the above for ransom. The risk across multiple similar projects is even greater. If code containing the credentials is reused across multiple projects, they will all be compromised.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Plan software architecture such that keys and passwords are always stored outside the code, wherever possible.\n* Plan encryption into software architecture for all credential information and ensure proper handling of keys, credentials, and passwords.\n* Prompt for a secure password on first login rather than hard-code a default password.\n* If a hardcoded password or credential must be used, limit its use, for example, to system console users rather than via the network.\n* Use strong hashes for inbound password authentication, ideally with randomly assigned salts to increase the difficulty level in case of brute-force attack.",

This helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks, in which an attacker gains access to sensitive session information and uses this information to trick legitimate web-based applications into disclosing confidential information or accepting illegitimate requests. When developers use the `HttpOnly` flag to set the cookie, they ensure that this sensitive session information is not readable or writable except by the browser (read) and server (write), respectively. While most modern browsers and versions now recognize the HttpOnly flag, some legacy and custom browsers still do not.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Include the `HttpOnly` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side. Be aware, however, that this crucial step provides only partial remediation.\n* Integrate client-side scripts to determine browser version; require browser compatibility or avoid transmitting sensitive data to browsers that do not support `HttpOnly`.\n* Understand and evaluate risks of third-party components or plugins, which may expose cookies.\n* Educate developers in a zero-trust approach, understanding the risks and best practices to prevent cross-site scripting, such as sanitizing all user input for code and special characters.",

                "markdown": "\n## Details\n\nThe `HttpOnly` flag is a simple parameter used when setting a user cookie to ensure that cookies with sensitive session data are visible only to the browser rather than to scripts. This helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks, in which an attacker gains access to sensitive session information and uses this information to trick legitimate web-based applications into disclosing confidential information or accepting illegitimate requests. When developers use the `HttpOnly` flag to set the cookie, they ensure that this sensitive session information is not readable or writable except by the browser (read) and server (write), respectively. While most modern browsers and versions now recognize the HttpOnly flag, some legacy and custom browsers still do not.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Include the `HttpOnly` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side. Be aware, however, that this crucial step provides only partial remediation.\n* Integrate client-side scripts to determine browser version; require browser compatibility or avoid transmitting sensitive data to browsers that do not support `HttpOnly`.\n* Understand and evaluate risks of third-party components or plugins, which may expose cookies.\n* Educate developers in a zero-trust approach, understanding the risks and best practices to prevent cross-site scripting, such as sanitizing all user input for code and special characters.",

This information may then be intercepted by threat actors using sniffer tools or interception techniques such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks (often involving social engineering). Attackers can then use information gleaned to perform a variety of actions, depending on the information type. Possible actions include gaining unauthorized access, impersonating a user, moving laterally within the organization's network, or retrieving and potentially modifying files. This weakness is almost completely avoidable through intelligent architecture and design.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Build web applications around a security mindset and the awareness that sniffers may be present at any time.\n* Ensure that all sensitive data transmission uses reliable encryption.\n* Implement security measures so that sensitive results are never returned in plain text.\n* Implement multiple-factor authentication methods to validate remote instances.\n* Use SSL not only at logon but throughout communications.",

Once the attacker has this information, they can potentially impersonate a user, accessing confidential data and performing actions that they would not normally be authorized to do. Attackers often gain access to this sensitive cookie data when it is transmitted insecurely in plain text over a standard HTTP session, rather than being encrypted and sent over an HTTPS session. This type of attack is highly preventable by following best practices when setting sensitive session cookies.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Set the `secure` attribute in the response header when setting cookies on the client side, and use a test tool to verify that secure cookie transmission is in place.\n* Always use HTTPS for all login pages and never redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, which leaves secure session data open to interception.\n* Follow other best practices when it comes to session cookies, such as setting the HttpOnly flag and maintaining highly time-limited sessions.\n* Consider implementing browser checks and providing secure data only within a browser that supports tight cookie security.\n* Generate session IDs in a way that is not easily predictable, invalidate sessions upon logout, and never reuse session IDs.\n* Educate developers to use built-in secure session-management functionality within the development environment instead of taking a DIY approach.",

                "markdown": "\n## Details\n\nCRLF is an abbreviation for the terms \"carriage return\" and \"line feed.\" These two special characters are a legacy of old-fashioned printing terminals used in the early days of computing. However, today both are still often used as delimiters between data. When this weakness exists, CR and LF characters (represented respectively in code as `\\r` and `\\n`) are permitted to be present in HTTP headers, usually due to poor planning for data handling during development.\n\nCRLF sequences in HTTP headers are known as \"response splitting\" because these characters effectively split the response from the browser, causing the single line to be accepted as multiple lines by the server (for example, the single line First Line\\r\\nSecond Line would be accepted by the server as two lines of input).\n\nWhile response splitting in itself is not an attack, and can be completely harmless unless exploited, its presence could lead to an injection attack (known as CRLF injection) and a variety of unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior. This weakness can be exploited in a number of ways, such as page hijacking or cross-user defacement, in which an attacker displays false site content and/or captures confidential information such as credentials. It can even lead to cross-site scripting attacks, in which attackers can cause malicious code to execute in the user's browser.\n\nFor example, the following code is vulnerable:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", request.getParameter(\"name\"));\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nbecause the user may provide a name parameter with a value like `XYZ\\r\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nATTACKER CONTROLLED`. In this case, they will produce a second HTTP response:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nATTACKER CONTROLLED\n```\n\nA possible fix is to remove all non-alphanumerical characters:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  String name = request.getParameter(\"name\")\n      .replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\");\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", name);\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the attacker would be unable to produce a second HTTP response.\n\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Assume all input is potentially malicious. Define acceptable responses wherever possible, and if not possible, encode CR and LF characters to prevent header splitting.\n* Replace both `\\r` (carriage return) and `\\n` (line feed) with \"\" (empty string)-many platforms handle these characters interchangeably so the weakness may still exist if one of the two is permitted.\nFollow best practices and strip all other special characters (\", /, \\, ;, etc., as well as spaces) wherever possible.\nBe sure to sanitize special characters in both directions-from the browser to the server and also in data sent back to the browser.\nIdeally, adopt current development resources, such as languages and libraries, that block CR and LF injection in headers.\nBe vigilant with all input types that could potentially be tampered with or modified at the user end (intentionally or unintentionally), which could lead to injection attacks. These include GET, POST, cookies, and other HTTP headers.",

In general, URL redirection refers to the ability of a website or application to redirect users to another site. This is often a benign and useful feature. For example, if a resource has moved to a new location, URL redirection can transfer the user to that location rather than displaying an error message.\nHowever, this ability can be exploited through social engineering, tricking the user into believing they are accessing one site when, in reality, they are being redirected to a dangerous site, such as a phishing site. Once there, the user may be further tricked into entering credentials or personally identifiable information (PII), believing they are still within the original, trusted domain. Attackers can then use these credentials to gain unauthorized access or leverage the user's PII for sale or ransom.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* When developing a site or web app, consider implementing a disclaimer page to remind users that they are leaving a secure site.\n* Adopt a zero-trust approach in which all input is treated with suspicion.\n* Validate all input against deny-lists to ensure it does not contain code to redirect the user. This method is good but inherently incomplete.\n* Be aware of all sources of untrusted input being sent to the server that could be used to redirect the user, such as cookies, URL components, filenames, query results, request headers, and more.\n* In particular, be aware of potential API calls that could send input indirectly to redirect the user.\n* To protect end users, use a firewall to block known malicious sites, train users to recognize basic signs of a phishing attack, and ensure that all network endpoints are patched with the most current updates.",

For example, an attacker can cause the execution of a regex that takes a long time to execute, resulting in performance degradation and possibly Denial of Service (DoS).\nRegular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid building dynamic regular expression that rely on user data\n* Escape regular expressions that are built from user data\n\n\n## References\n* [Regular expression Denial of Service](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)",

This means that browsers can only retrieve data from another site if the two sites share the same domain. In today's complex online environment, however, sites and applications often need to retrieve data from other domains. This is done under fairly limited conditions through an exception to the same origin policy known as \"cross-origin resource sharing\".\n\nDevelopers may create definitions of trusted domains that are broader than absolutely necessary, inadvertently opening up wider access than intended. This weakness could result in data exposure or loss, or even allow an attacker to take over the site or application.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid using wildcards for cross-origin resource sharing. Instead, define intended domains explicitly.\n* Ensure that your site or app is well defended against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), which could lead to takeover via an overly permissive cross-domain policy.\n* Do not mix secure and insecure protocols when defining cross-domain policies.\n* Consider defining a clear approved list to specify which domains will be given resource-level access; use this approved list to validate all domain access requests.\n* Clearly define which methods (view, read, and update) are permitted for each resource and domain to avoid abuse.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```",

These commands can then be executed on the application server, potentially leading to harmful consequences, including data exposure or deletion. Like code injection attacks, command injection attacks are essentially a failure of data validation. Unlike code injection attacks, which introduce new code, command injection attacks use existing system functions, often taking advantage of the application's unnecessarily high privilege level, increasing the risk of serious harm and reputational damage.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n- Never trust user input. Assume any input may transmit harmful values.\n- Adopt the principle of least privilege: No application should have a greater access level than needed to run its required tasks.\n- Control user access policies on a task-by-task basis.\n- Don't pass user input directly to the system; use libraries or APIs that lack system access.\n- Where shell commands must be passed, escape values using functions like shlex for Python, or escapeshellarg() for PHP.\n- Sanitize user input with regular expressions to define permitted characters along with maximum string length.\n- Convert special characters such as `& |  ; $ > < \\ !` before passing to the server.\n- Whitelist permitted commands and validate user responses against these expectations.\n- Remember that code injection can take place on multiple fronts: GET and POST requests, but also cookies and HTTP headers.\n- Ensure up-to-date patching across all systems to remediate known vulnerabilities.\n- Educate all team members on safer data handling procedures to prevent attacks.",

The XML processor then uses the system identifier to access the resource rather than using the URI. When this weakness exists, the application permits user-supplied data, which could include the address of an XML external identity, to be passed directly to the XML parser. The application will then attempt to retrieve documents from outside of secure, controlled areas.\n\nAttackers can exploit this weakness to expose sensitive data, execute port scanning on the server side, or launch a denial-of-service attack (DoS) such as Billion Laughs.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n\n* When possible, disable loading of data from external entities. The method of doing this will vary based on the language and XML parser being used.\n* Use a local, static document type definitions (DTDs) and ensure that external DTDs are disallowed entirely.\n* If user input cannot be avoided, perform validation against an allowlist of possible data sources. However, as long as external DTDs are allowed, XML code remains inherently vulnerable to attacks exploiting this weakness.",

                "markdown": "\n## Details\n\nCRLF is an abbreviation for the terms \"carriage return\" and \"line feed.\" These two special characters are a legacy of old-fashioned printing terminals used in the early days of computing. However, today both are still often used as delimiters between data. When this weakness exists, CR and LF characters (represented respectively in code as `\\r` and `\\n`) are permitted to be present in HTTP headers, usually due to poor planning for data handling during development.\n\nCRLF sequences in HTTP headers are known as \"response splitting\" because these characters effectively split the response from the browser, causing the single line to be accepted as multiple lines by the server (for example, the single line First Line\\r\\nSecond Line would be accepted by the server as two lines of input).\n\nWhile response splitting in itself is not an attack, and can be completely harmless unless exploited, its presence could lead to an injection attack (known as CRLF injection) and a variety of unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior. This weakness can be exploited in a number of ways, such as page hijacking or cross-user defacement, in which an attacker displays false site content and/or captures confidential information such as credentials. It can even lead to cross-site scripting attacks, in which attackers can cause malicious code to execute in the user's browser.\n\nFor example, the following code is vulnerable:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", request.getParameter(\"name\"));\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nbecause the user may provide a name parameter with a value like `XYZ\\r\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nATTACKER CONTROLLED`. In this case, they will produce a second HTTP response:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nATTACKER CONTROLLED\n```\n\nA possible fix is to remove all non-alphanumerical characters:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  String name = request.getParameter(\"name\")\n      .replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\");\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", name);\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the attacker would be unable to produce a second HTTP response.\n\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Assume all input is potentially malicious. Define acceptable responses wherever possible, and if not possible, encode CR and LF characters to prevent header splitting.\n* Replace both `\\r` (carriage return) and `\\n` (line feed) with \"\" (empty string)-many platforms handle these characters interchangeably so the weakness may still exist if one of the two is permitted.\nFollow best practices and strip all other special characters (\", /, \\, ;, etc., as well as spaces) wherever possible.\nBe sure to sanitize special characters in both directions-from the browser to the server and also in data sent back to the browser.\nIdeally, adopt current development resources, such as languages and libraries, that block CR and LF injection in headers.\nBe vigilant with all input types that could potentially be tampered with or modified at the user end (intentionally or unintentionally), which could lead to injection attacks. These include GET, POST, cookies, and other HTTP headers.",

Developers may rely on plain-text storage of credentials when they believe the system is completely secure from attack or only accessible to insiders. This confidence is misguided and dangerous. If a malicious insider-such as a former employee-or a hostile attacker using SQL injection, XML injection, or a brute-force attack accesses the system, they can access this credential information to gain unauthorized permissions within the system and to export other confidential and secure information.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Ensure that passwords are never stored in plain text, even for \"purely internal\" use.\n* Never rely on password encoding, such as base 64 encoding; choose a complex encryption algorithm that includes salting, then hashing.\n* Implement zero-trust approaches in which users have access only to information needed for legitimate business purposes.\n* To the greatest extent possible, secure the application against injection attacks and other types of weaknesses.",
